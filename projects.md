Here is a list of those of my projects that from my point of view
are the most valuable.

[Emacspeak](https://github.com/poretsky/emacspeak) -- The complete
Emacs-based audio desktop. It was originally forked from
[tvraman/emacspeak](https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak), but now
includes a lot of extra enhancements and fixes along with the
packaging means for several popular Linux distributions. Actual state
of this work can be found in the respective branches:

- [xenial](https://github.com/poretsky/emacspeak/tree/xenial) --
  Ubuntu 16.04 package
- [bionic](https://github.com/poretsky/emacspeak/tree/bionic) --
  Ubuntu 18.04 package
- [focal](https://github.com/poretsky/emacspeak/tree/focal) --
  Ubuntu 20.04 package
- [jammy](https://github.com/poretsky/emacspeak/tree/jammy) --
  Ubuntu 22.04 package
- [stretch](https://github.com/poretsky/emacspeak/tree/stretch) --
  Debian 9 package
- [buster](https://github.com/poretsky/emacspeak/tree/buster) --
  Debian 10 package
- [bullseye](https://github.com/poretsky/emacspeak/tree/bullseye) --

[Multispeech](https://github.com/poretsky/multispeech) -- Multilingual
speech server for **Emacspeak** featuring a capability to detect
language automatically by a nature of text and choose an appropriate
voice. In addition it can serve as a backend for **Speech Dispatcher**
providing multilingual speech output facility for **Orca** screen
reader as well.

[Ru_tts](https://github.com/poretsky/ru_tts) -- Russian speech
synthesizer. An alternative implementation of the well-known
**Phonemophone-5**. Being written in pure C it is extremely compact
and lightweight.

[RuLex](https://github.com/poretsky/rulex) -- Russian pronunciation
dictionary originally designed for **Ru_tts** speech synthesizer
facilitation by providing stress information.

[FreeSpeech](https://github.com/poretsky/freespeech) -- English text
to phoneme converter and pronunciation dictionary that being used
along with **MBROLA** speech synthesizer forms full TTS conversion for
English language. Originates from the archive found at
[http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola/tts/English/fs.a10m.tar.gz](http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola/tts/English/fs.a10m.tar.gz)

[Youtube-dl-el](https://github.com/poretsky/youtube-dl-emacs) -- Emacs
interface for **Youtube**. Originally forked from
[skeeto/youtube-dl-emacs](https://github.com/skeeto/youtube-dl-emacs),
but greatly enhanced. Now it is not only a Youtube downloader, but in
conjunction with **W3m** web browser serves for easy browsing and
searching **Youtube** as well.

[Gh-subscription](https://github.com/poretsky/gh-subscription) --
GitHub CLI extension for subscription management.

[SmartVoice-translations](https://github.com/poretsky/SmartVoice-translations) --
Translatable resource of the [SmartVoice](android/smartvoice/index.md)
speech synthesizer which is not opensource itself.

Of course, this list is not exhaustive, but those who are curious
about other my projects, are welcome to
