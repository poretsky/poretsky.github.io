This simple application is intended first of all for those musicians
who like to tune their instruments relying mainly on ears rather than
using various modern tuners with visual indication, or for all who
needs a reference musical tone for any reason. It produces an audible
reference tone by demand just like a classic tuning fork, and, being
installed on a smartphone, is always ready to use.

{% capture apk_file %}TuningFork-{{ site.data.tuningfork.version }}.apk{% endcapture %}
{% capture assets_url %}{{ site.data.tuningfork.assets }}{{ site.data.tuningfork.version }}{% endcapture %}

Application interface is available in English, Russian and Belarusian.

By the way, I'd like to thank translators:

- **Uladzimir Charaukhin** for Belarusian.

This application is open source. So, welcome to the
[project page](https://github.com/poretsky/TuningFork) or
download
{% include download.md file=apk_file url=assets_url %}
if you like, install it on your smartphone and use.

Or preferably install it from
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.github.poretsky.tuningfork/)
and get automatic updates and additional security.

[Android 6.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Marshmallow)
or later is required.
